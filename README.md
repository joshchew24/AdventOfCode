Solutions written using Python 3, some use numpy 1.12.4.

## Day 11:
This is the first reflection I'm writing. Not really sure what I want these to be but for now I will just be jotting down some thoughts I had about the problem. I may retroactively do the same for the days I missed.  
This day felt like a more challenging combination of day 6 and day 9. I always run into bugs when switching between traditional x,y coordinates and indexing numpy 2-D arrays by row, then column. Found the flashing and energy distribution behaviour interesting to implement. Landed on a queue-based solution that I am quite pleased with, though the code is fairly verbose.
